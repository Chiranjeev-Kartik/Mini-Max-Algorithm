# Tic-Tac-Toe
Using Mini-Max algorithm to design Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, and statistics, for minimizing the possible loss
for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain.
To illustrate the minimax algorithm more, let’s take a look at a visual example. In the diagram below, consider a situation 
where it’s X’s turn given the current state. X has three possible moves:
